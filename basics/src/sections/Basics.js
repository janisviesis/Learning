      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the front and gives structure to
        the webpage, which you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to style the front end of any website.
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your pages. You may have seen common examples
